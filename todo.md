1. Most importantly, how am I going to run this? Figure that out...will it run when I power on my computer? Can I get it run in the background on my phone? Or on a command from my phone?
    - use pythonanywhere.com
2. experiment with nickiscold@gmail.com... get OAuth working again. Just try to do something simple, like marking an email as read. This will remind me of how to use the api
3. Setup project structure
4. Implement the kicking off a a filter, still using nickiscold
	- https://developers.google.com/gmail/api/guides/filter_settings
	- https://developers.google.com/gmail/api/v1/reference/users/settings/filters
	- https://developers.google.com/gmail/api/guides/labels
5. If I work out the above, then put in the actual filter I want, and try it out
6. Try to get this running once a day
